# IS218 Final Project
Anthony Parrinello - For the calendar, I synced it with my personal Google Calendar. You can see that it successfully pulled my events from Google Calendar to the new calendar and if you click on the events, you are brought to an active Google Calendar. 
If you move onto future months, you can click the "Today" button to be brought back to the current month.
You can click the "Add Event" button to create a sample event.
